## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- At least one *arr application running with API access:
  - [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) for TV series
  - [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) for movies
  - [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/) for music
  - [Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com/) for indexer management
  - [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/) for Plex play history (optional)
  - [Seerr](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr) for media request management (optional)
  - [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/) for media server health checks (optional)

## Installation

### Using npm (Recommended)

```bash
npx mcp-arr-server
```

### Remote HTTP Mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=3000 npx mcp-arr-server
```

By default the remote server listens on `127.0.0.1:3000` and serves MCP on `/mcp`.

Environment variables for remote mode:

- `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` to enable remote Streamable HTTP transport
- `HOST` to override the bind host (default `127.0.0.1`)
- `PORT` to override the port (default `3000`)
- `MCP_PATH` to override the MCP endpoint path (default `/mcp`)

### Docker

Build locally:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-arr .
```

Run in local stdio mode:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e SONARR_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8989 \
  -e SONARR_API_KEY=your-sonarr-api-key \
  mcp-arr
```

Run in remote HTTP mode:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e SONARR_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8989 \
  -e SONARR_API_KEY=your-sonarr-api-key \
  mcp-arr
```

Minimal `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  mcp-arr:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      MCP_TRANSPORT: http
      HOST: 0.0.0.0
      PORT: 3000
      SONARR_URL: http://host.docker.internal:8989
      SONARR_API_KEY: your-sonarr-api-key
      RADARR_URL: http://host.docker.internal:7878
      RADARR_API_KEY: your-radarr-api-key
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr.git
cd mcp-arr
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Getting API Keys

Each *arr application has an API key in Settings > General > Security:

1. Open your *arr application's web interface
2. Go to **Settings** > **General**
3. Find the **API Key** under the Security section
4. Copy the API key for use in configuration

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arr": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-arr-server"],
      "env": {
        "SONARR_URL": "http://localhost:8989",
        "SONARR_API_KEY": "your-sonarr-api-key",
        "RADARR_URL": "http://localhost:7878",
        "RADARR_API_KEY": "your-radarr-api-key",
        "LIDARR_URL": "http://localhost:8686",
        "LIDARR_API_KEY": "your-lidarr-api-key",
        "PROWLARR_URL": "http://localhost:9696",
        "PROWLARR_API_KEY": "your-prowlarr-api-key",
        "TAUTULLI_URL": "http://localhost:8181/tautulli",
        "TAUTULLI_API_KEY": "your-tautulli-api-key",
        "SEERR_URL": "https://seerr.yourdomain.com",
        "SEERR_API_KEY": "your-seerr-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arr": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-arr-server"],
      "env": {
        "SONARR_URL": "http://localhost:8989",
        "SONARR_API_KEY": "your-sonarr-api-key",
        "RADARR_URL": "http://localhost:7878",
        "RADARR_API_KEY": "your-radarr-api-key",
        "TAUTULLI_URL": "http://localhost:8181/tautulli",
        "TAUTULLI_API_KEY": "your-tautulli-api-key",
        "SEERR_URL": "https://seerr.yourdomain.com",
        "SEERR_API_KEY": "your-seerr-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Only configure the services you have running. The server automatically detects which services are available based on the environment variables you provide.

**TRaSH-only mode**: if you don’t configure any *arr services, the server still starts and exposes the TRaSH Guides reference tools plus generic `search` and `fetch`.

## ChatGPT / Remote MCP

To use `mcp-arr` with ChatGPT, run the server in remote HTTP mode on a reachable host and connect ChatGPT to the `/mcp` endpoint.

The server now exposes the generic `search` and `fetch` tools expected by ChatGPT-style remote MCP integrations:

- `search` discovers matching *arr media and TRaSH profiles
- `fetch` returns structured detail for a selected search result

The existing service-specific tools remain available for richer local or power-user workflows.

The `{service}_review_setup` tool returns all configuration in a single call, enabling natural language conversations about optimizing your setup. Claude can analyze your quality profiles, suggest improvements, explain why certain content isn't being grabbed, and help configure complex settings like custom formats.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer**: The configuration review tools provide **read-only** access to your *arr settings. Any changes to your configuration must be made directly in the *arr application interfaces. The AI's suggestions are recommendations only - always back up your configuration before making significant changes. The maintainers are not responsible for any configuration changes, data loss, or other issues that may arise from following AI-generated recommendations.

### TRaSH Guides Tools

Access community-curated quality profiles, custom formats, and naming conventions from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/) directly through Claude or ChatGPT. These tools work without any *arr configuration - they fetch reference data from the TRaSH Guides GitHub repository.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `trash_list_profiles` | List available TRaSH quality profiles for Radarr or Sonarr |
| `trash_get_profile` | Get detailed profile with custom formats, scores, and quality settings |
| `trash_list_custom_formats` | List custom formats with optional category filter (hdr, audio, resolution, etc.) |
| `trash_get_naming` | Get recommended naming conventions for Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, or standard |
| `trash_get_quality_sizes` | Get recommended min/max/preferred sizes for each quality level |
| `trash_compare_profile` | Compare your profile against TRaSH recommendations (requires *arr configured) |
| `trash_compare_naming` | Compare your naming config against TRaSH recommendations (requires *arr configured) |

**Example usage:**
- "What quality profiles does TRaSH recommend for 4K movies?"
- "Show me the remux-web-1080p profile details"
- "Compare my Radarr profile 4 against the TRaSH uhd-bluray-web profile"
- "What naming convention should I use for Plex?"
- "List HDR-related custom formats for Radarr"

Data is cached for 1 hour to minimize GitHub API calls.

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Run locally
SONARR_URL="http://localhost:8989" SONARR_API_KEY="your-key" TAUTULLI_URL="http://localhost:8181/tautulli" TAUTULLI_API_KEY="your-key" SEERR_URL="https://seerr.yourdomain.com" SEERR_API_KEY="your-key" node dist/index.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No *arr services configured"
Ensure you have set at least one pair of URL and API_KEY environment variables:
```bash
SONARR_URL="http://localhost:8989"
SONARR_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### "API error: 401 Unauthorized"
The API key is incorrect. Verify it in your *arr application under Settings > General > Security.

### "fetch failed" or "ECONNREFUSED"
The *arr application is not running or the URL is incorrect. Verify:
- The application is running
- The URL and port are correct
- There's no firewall blocking the connection

### "Sonarr/Radarr/etc not configured"
You tried to use a tool for a service that isn't configured. Add the corresponding URL and API_KEY environment variables.
